# RoboG
# 👣 RoboG — Biped Walking Robot
**A six-servo biped powered by Arduino Uno + MPU6050, learning balance like a toddler with dreams of parkour.**

## 🧩 What RoboG Tries to Do
- Walk without holding onto the table (ambition).
- Shift weight from foot to foot like organic gait.
- Use MPU6050 readings for balance correction.
- Keep the Arduino head stable even while legs move.

## ⚙️ Hardware Setup
| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Arduino Uno | Brain |
| 6x Servo Motors | Hip, Knee, Foot joints |
| MPU6050 | Orientation + balance |
| Battery Pack | Mobility |
| Frame | Custom build |

## 🧠 Challenges I'm Solving
- Center of mass shift
- Step cycle timing
- Servo torque vs weight
- Head-mounted Arduino balancing

> Current status: **In Progress**
> Standing, pivoting, early steps happening, balance tuning ongoing.
